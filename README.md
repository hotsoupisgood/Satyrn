# python-live
python-live's purpose is to allow for the easy running of python scripts that contain graphs. This idea spawned out of the utility which I saw in Jupyter and my desire to run vim as my editor.

## Installation
To install the script, run python3 setup.py install   

## How to use
Run 'livepy (File you want to run)'

To display plots in line with your code, insert a '###p' where you want the plot.

This script auto-runs your python file and displays it in a browser.  

It supports matplotlib plots and displays them inline with python code.
