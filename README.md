# python-live
python-live's purpose is to allow for the easy running of python scripts that contain graphs. This idea spawned out of the utility which I saw in Jupyter and my desire to run vim as my editor.  
** This program only works with matplotlib graphs.

## Installation
To install the script, run ```python3 setup.py install``` 

## How to use
Run ```livepy (File you want to run)```

To display plots in line with your code, insert a ```###p``` where you want the plot.
  
In your browser of choice go to ``` localhost:5000 ```
